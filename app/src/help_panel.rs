## 1. Writing & Managing Notes

- **Auto-Save**: Notes are continuously saved to high-speed SQLite storage without manual effort.
- `Ctrl + N`: Instantly creates a new blank document ready for typing.

## 2. Hybrid vs. Vim Modes

- **Hybrid Mode**: Modern editor experience with intuitive hotkeys, smooth cursor glide, and auto-pairing for brackets and quotes.
- **Vim Mode**: Pure home-row modal editing with Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command lines.
- **Switching Modes**: Type `:vim` or `:mode vim` / `:mode hybrid` in the command bar to switch anytime.
- **Living Carets in Vim**: Your custom animated caret stays uniform and visible across all Vim submodes.

## 3. Living Animated Carets & Typing Sounds

- **9 Animated Carets**: Choose from Candle, Fire, Water, Snow, Neon, Rainbow, Block, Beam, and Underline.
- **Ambient Life**: Water drips into baseline ripples, candle flickers gently, fire micro-embers dance.
- **Mechanical Sound Profiles**: Authentic synthesized switch audio: Thocky, Clacky, Creamy, Marbly, and Poppy.
- **Preferences**: Press `Ctrl + ,` to open Settings and customize carets, themes, and audio.

- `:set showcmd`: Enables the floating keystroke & operator HUD card.
- `:set noshowcmd`: Disables the floating HUD (aliases: `:set nonshowcmd`, `:noshowcmd`).
